# Advent of Code

## CJ's Private Leaderboard

This repo contains my Advent of Code solutions over the years. I still have yet to complete all challenges for a given year.

Perhaps **2024** is the year to get them all!

My ultimate goal is to do all challenges in a different language (or perhaps just several different languages 😄) like Rosa Gutierrez did below.
