# Advent of Code

This repo contains my Advent of Code solutions over the years. I still have yet to complete all challenges for a given year.

Perhaps **2022** is the year to get them all! My ultimate goal is to do all challenges in a different language (or perhaps just several different languages ðŸ˜„) like Rosa Gutierrez did below.

## Languages used each year (so far)

| ---- | ---------- | ------ |
| 2019 | Python     | 8 ðŸ˜™   |
| 2020 | Javascript | 14 ðŸ˜Š  |
| 2021 | Javascript | 3 ðŸ¤¨   |
| 2022 | Javascript | ? ðŸ’ª   |
